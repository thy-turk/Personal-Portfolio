                <p class="bio-para">Hello, my name is Tucker Fiumara and I was born in Colorado.
                    Growing up two of my favorite things were baseball and
                    snowboarding. I'm excited to learn more about coding
                    and I can't wait to get started with new material. There is 
                    something so satisfying about writing new and challenging code
                    and having it actually work. I look forward to what new things I 
                    will learn about in the future and where those things will take 
                    me.
